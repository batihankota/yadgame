# Yet Another Door Game
This is a simple simulation of the Monty Hall problem implemented in JavaScript. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario.

In the game, the contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door, there is a valuable prize (a car), and behind the other two, there are less desirable prizes (goats).

The contestant chooses one door, and then the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a less valuable prize. The contestant is then given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.

This simulation allows the user to experience the Monty Hall problem and see the outcome of both sticking with the original choice and switching doors.
